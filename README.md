# Logistic-Regression-Diabetes-Prediction
### Logistic Regression: Diabetes Prediction

🔬🤖The main objective of this machine learning project is to build a logistic regression model to predict the presence or absence of diabetes in individuals based on predictor features available in the dataset📊.

🎯Given that false negatives should be avoided in the medical field, a key focus is to improve the recall score of the model. Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, measures the ability of the model to correctly identify positive instances (diabetes cases) out of all the actual positive instances📚.

🔍💻To address the issue of imbalanced dataset, where the number of diabetes cases may be significantly smaller than non-diabetes cases, resampling techniques can be employed. Resampling involves either oversampling the minority class (diabetes cases) or undersampling the majority class (non-diabetes cases) to create a balanced dataset. This helps to mitigate the impact of class imbalance on model performance🌱.

💪Furthermore, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with Cross Validation is utilized to improve the prediction capabilities of the model. RFE is a feature selection technique that recursively eliminates less informative features, thereby enhancing the model's ability to focus on the most relevant predictors. Cross Validation is employed to iteratively evaluate the performance of the model on different subsets of the data, ensuring robustness and generalizability🌟.

🧠💡By implementing these techniques, we aim to develop a logistic regression model that effectively predicts diabetes, with a particular emphasis on improving the recall score📈.
